<body>My beloved Asifa,  

    You are the heartbeat of my soul and the reason behind my every smile. Every moment I spend with you feels like a piece of heaven, and the warmth of your love surrounds me like the safest embrace. You are my strength, my peace, and the most precious blessing in my life. I thank the universe every day for bringing you into my world. My love for you grows deeper with every breath, and I promise to cherish you endlessly, my jaan. ❤️
